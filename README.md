# Fresh.css
Fresh.css is a new web design framework/starting point, with simple, easy to use classes and relatively small file sizes, while still holding up in complexity.

There are currently two versions of Fresh.CSS. The Lemon Edition and the Lime Edition.

## The Lemon Edition
The Fresh.CSS Lemon Edition is the most basic version of Fresh. With 364 Lines of Code, it is small, compact, and simple to use.

The Lemon Edition (LeEd for short) contains the following features:
- Basic Top Navigation
- 4 Different padded container sizes
- 12 Collumn Grid System
- 2 Styles of buttons (Both can conform to panels or be seperate sizes)
- Simple table design
- Styles Blockquotes and perferated code

## The Lime Edition
The Fresh.CSS Lime Edition is similar to LeEd, except for the added Color schemes. With only 637 lines of code, almost everything can be colored exactly how you like it, or based on it's parent color. There are ten colors in LiEd (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Black, Dark Gray, and Light Gray), but there may be more in a future commit.

# Conclusion
If you would like to see more, please make sure to check out Fresh.CSS, and use it! Tell me what you think! I am working on the Orange Edition (Advanced, estimated 1,000-2,500 lines of code) and the Grapefruit Edition (Advanced with extensive color themes, schemes, and customizations, estimated 2,000-3,000 lines of code) and a "beta" version should be out in the next few weeks.

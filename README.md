# Fresh Framework
Fresh is an open source, modern CSS and JavaScript framework for lightweight, mobile-responsive web apps and sites.

You can get more info at https://usefresh.org and view documentation at https://usefresh.org/docs

## Why Use Fresh?
Fresh is a simpler approach to modern web design. Many WYSIWYG websites are overly simplified and don't allow much customization, while frameworks like Bulma and Bootstrap offer oftentimes complicated solutions for simple elements on your page. Why not get the best of both worlds? A customizable but lightweight css and js framework that loads fast and makes you're life easier.

## Coding in Fresh
Imagine trying to create a side navigation for a web app you are developing. In many frameworks, these would be so confusing to make. However, creating web app menus has never been easier with Fresh.

```HTML
<div class="nav side nav-top">
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="account">
        <img class="avatar primary left outlined" src="images/profile.png">
        <div class="info left">
            <p>Jane Doe</p>
            <a class="item">log out</a>
        </div>
        <div class="clear"></div>
    </div><hr>
    <a class="item active">Dashboard</a>
    <a class="item">Messages</a>
    <a class="item">Emails</a>
    <a class="item">Business Stuff</a>
    <a class="item">Web App Stuff</a>
</div>
```

This is one of the easiest ways to create one, but you can create even more customized and complex menus with Fresh too!

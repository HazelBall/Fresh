# Fresh.css
## Experimental Edition

### Updates
It's been a long time since I last worked on Fresh, but after building almost three other websites and redesigns to websites, I decided to come back to it. I really like the new version of my personal website, and I wanted to work towards making Fresh look similar but also improved and less custom in different aspects, to give people more choice. Although there is only one current website using Fresh.css, I am hoping when this new version is done (which I will name after some sort of fruit or citrus. That's how I'm going to name them from now on), I will share it with more people to get people to use it. I am also planning on using JSDelivr in order to give people the option of linking from a CDN, as that makes everything more convieniant, and because it will automatically create the minified css and js to make everything easier.

### What is Fresh.css
Fresh.css is a lightweight CSS and JavaScript framework used for easily customizable web app design and functionality, without all the bloatedness of larger web app and website frameworks, and with more functionality with barebone frameworks and boilerplates.

Fresh.css is designed for lightweight web apps and websites. It uses aspects of Material Design, along with Flat Design 2.0, to enhance the minimalistic yet powerful design. Everything is easy to create and customize.

			<h2>Colors</h2>
			<p>The Fresh.CSS Lime Edition was created with colors and simplicity in mind, for those who want easy colors and design, without all the extra code. With just 638 Lines of Code, the Lime Edition is perfect for small but colorful projects!</p><br>
			<p>If you want more color options, we are working on an advanced version of the Lime Edition, the Grapefruit Edition, which will have much more of an extensive color pallete, so be on the look out for new commits to the repository!</p>

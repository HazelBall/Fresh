Version 1.1.0

Description:
	General Improvements on design of elements. New font used and some new classes to help you make awesome sites. New documentation will be released soon to reflect the changes so far and offer more guidance with examples of code.
~~~~
Additions:

			- Create a modal-specific closing anchor with the "trigger" anchor inside of the modal
			- Clicking outside open modals close them
		- Alerts
			- Designed similarly to modals, as they are basically smaller bottom modals
			- As with modals, you can use the "trigger" class inside to create a top right button to close them
			- Alerts have special "warning" class that makes them red, just because this is an common function for them
		- Accordions
			- Using accordion-headers, you can create lists of Accordions
			- Work similar to modals and alerts within javascript
			- use the data-accordion attribute to link any object with accordion
			- Accordions are not colored by default, allowing you to use them in different scenarios
		- Custom Tethers

	- icon class for logos in top navigation

Removals

~~~~~
Changes
	- original .color-accent, etc. changed to .text-inv-accent, etc. to impose less confusion

		- Dropdowns can now also have disabled items
	- Changed some looks on mobile to perform and look better

	- Tetherable elements
		- Tetherable elements are elements that can be interacted with using other elements, 'tethered' to them.
		- Modals
			- modifyable with small and large classes
			- Open and close specific modals by using the "data-tether" attribute and the modal's id
			- Create a modal-specific closing anchor with the "trigger" anchor inside of the modal
			- Clicking outside open modals close them
		- Alerts
			- Designed similarly to modals, as they are basically smaller bottom modals
			- As with modals, you can use the "trigger" class inside to create a top right button to close them
			- Alerts have special "warning" class that makes them red, just because this is an common function for them
		- Accordions
			- Using accordion-headers, you can create lists of Accordions
			- Work similar to modals and alerts within javascript
			- use the data-accordion attribute to link any object with accordion
			- Accordions are not colored by default, allowing you to use them in different scenarios
		- Custom Tethers
			- Want to easily create your own tetherable? Well it's easy. Just create a tether with a custom ID and 
	- icon class for logos in top navigation
	- Active Footer item styling

Removals
	- removed img.rounded as .rounded is already functioning
	- Removed JQuery dependancies within JavaScript file, Fresh.CSS now runs solely on JavaScript!
	- Removed the useless header-image class (not sure when this class was added but it was only for documentation and unnecessary)
~~~~~
Changes
	- original .color-accent, etc. changed to .text-inv-accent, etc. to impose less confusion
	- Changed color of blockquote slightly
	- Changed the look of Navigation as a whole to look more sleek and modern
		- Navigation design has been completely revamped to create a cleaner experience for all display sizes
		- Dropdowns can now also have disabled items
	- Changed some looks on mobile to perform and look better
	- Changed some of the design for headers, specifically on mobile
	- headings and paragraphs now have spaces in between so you don't have to use <br> so often
